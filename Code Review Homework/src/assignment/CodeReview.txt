Formatting:
- Inconsistent case used when declaring variables, snake case must be used.
- Variables should be declared on separate lines of code.
- In comments, words should be spaced with a space, not tabs.
- Inconsistent case used in function names, camel case must be used.
- Long lines of code should be split on multiple lines.
- Formatting should be applied.

Meaningful names:
- The class name should me more representative. (Changed it to BankAccount.)
- Getter and setter functions should be named correctly.
- Functions should use intention-revealing names.

Classes:
- The static ints should be placed in an enum.
- Classes should be small.
- The class should be marked as final, if not used for inheritance.
- Class attributes are set to public, they should be changed to private or protected.

Functions:
- There are variables that are not used.
- There are too many variables that store a number. (Magic numbers.)
- Print lines in getter functions are not good.
- Use "this." to avoid misunderstanding.
- The print function is not needed.
- Exceptions are too general.
- Unnecessary else statements.
- To_string function should be renamed toString and set to override.
- Constructor should initialise days_active.

Comments:
- Redundant comments are not needed.
- Comments should be placed as not to make the code harder to read.
